## Frequently asked Questions
### Question answer:

WIF500 real?</br>
To find out, you need to go through a very large range and find out.</br>
This requires large GPU resources.<hr>

Why is the program without source codes?</br>
The correct ranges and other parameters are sewn into the WifSolverCuda program.</br>
Knowing them, the user can find the key on his own and take everything for himself.<hr>

Does the program require an internet connection?</br>
No, the program is looking for the key offline.<hr>

If I find the key can I take all the coins for myself?</br>
No, you will find the encrypted key.</br>
Only the organizers of the challenge can decrypt this key and pay you a donation.<hr>

There is a video in which there is a similar key.</br>
There are errors in the video that make the key impossible to find.<hr>

I have many GPUs. How to start?</br>
Run each GPU separately with a new range Add your card id -d ?</br>
For RTX 2070, 2080, 2090, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3090, A5000, A6000</br>
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 444 -d 0```</br>
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 445 -d 1```</br>
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 446 -d 2```</br>
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 2057 -d 3```</br>
```wif500-20xx.exe -range 888 -d 4```</br>
If you have any difficulties with the launch, you can ask in the group<hr>

Where did the diary photo come from?</br>
The man worked at the exchange office.</br> 
Through it, the miner withdrew coins. </br>
Somehow, the miner turned to the exchange office with a request to help him restore the key in the photo from the burnt diary.</br>
In 2017, there was no GPU program. GPU cards at that time were weaker than the GTX 1060. </br>
It took more than 1000 years to search on the CPU. </br>
This is a very difficult task. The photo went from hand to hand.</br>
Years have passed.</br>
I was approached by a person (intermediary) who offered to find the key for 50% of the amount.</br> 
After counting the combinations, it turned out that I needed to rent 3364 RTX 3090 cards for 4 days.</br>
It's $50-70,000. This is a big amount of risk.</br>
The intermediary was asked to make a challenge and if the key is found, he will receive 10%. He agreed.</br>
A program was developed and the challenge was launched.<hr>

Who is the owner of the diary?</br>
This is a common stupid question. Let's say Indian. What does it change? For understanding.</br> 
Bitcoin is an anonymous system. The owner is the one who has the key.<hr>

Is this theft?</br>
No.</br>
The author of the diary took the photo himself.</br> 
Thus, he made a public key out of a private key and gave it to third parties.<hr>

Where is the guarantee that you will give 200 btc donat to the hunter after he gives you the encrypted key?</br>
If you have doubts you can search by yourself. Where is the guarantee that if you find it, you will give half?</br>
If not greedy 500 coins is a lot - enough for everyone.</br>
I need active hunters for other challenges, so there is no point in cheating.<hr>

What happens if the key is not found?</br>
Nothing. Write on the photo SOLVED. Let's start another challenge and we'll look for it.<hr>

How to know that the key is found by someone?</br>
Verify transactions on the blockchain.<hr>

What happens if someone who is not a hunter finds a key like a pirate (miner)?</br>
I doubt that anyone will share with us.</br>
The challenge will be stopped.</br>
While the coins are in place, we are looking for.<hr>

Why did you post a photo of the diary?</br>
Initially, a few additional letters were crossed out in the challenge.</br>
But, on bittalk they posted all the symbols of the key from the diary. Therefore, there is no point in hiding them.<hr>


Are you looking for a compressed key, maybe it's uncompressed?</br>
The key is 99.9% compressed.</br>
Experienced programmers worked on the key.</br>
Few facts.</br>
In the photo below is an uncompressed key.</br>
All addresses after 03/30/2012 are compressed.</br>
When decoded, the known part of the key yields a compressed flag.</br>
All addresses in the blockchain transaction chain are compressed.</br>
There are many other facts indicating that the key is compressed.<hr>


Maybe you made a mistake in the handwriting and we are looking for it wrong, there is not b but 5, the third G, etc.</br>
Worked on the key:</br>
1 Forensic expert (according to suicide notes) for a fee.</br>
1 Restorer of ancient manuscripts.</br>
3 doctors (Latin medical handwriting)</br>
1 Apothecary (pharmacist) prescriptions from the doctor sometimes look much worse :-)</br>
10 literate people for whom American is their native language.</br>
Our team processed the photos, making their own expertise and experiments.</br>
On the basis of paw examinations, kandillata were added before ?5.... These are the blue ranges in the table.</br>
The key we are retrieving looks like this:</br>
```5bCRZhiS5sEGMpmcRZdpAhmWLRfMmutGmPHtjVob```<hr>

Bro help?</br>
I have a weak card, help me, tell me the key.</br> 
I don't know how to run. Look right,</br> 
I'm running. I don't have gpu.</br> 
hahaha I went through everything, it's empty.</br> 
It's fake. I don't understand anything, but you still help me.</br>

I have a telegram full of similar messages. </br>
It's hard to answer the same questions to everyone.</br>
Write such questions in the questions to the program. </br>
Prompt each other, who figured it out, help, discuss it there. </br>
Questions not related to the challenge do not write to me.<hr>

phrutis why are you deleting hunters and being so demanding on screenshots?</br>
I believe that the group does not need observers (not active hunters)</br>
Why are they there to us?</br>
If a person is added, then he has read the rules. </br>
He should tell me the range number he has chosen and is looking for.</br> 
If he only plans to do it, he will be added when he is ready.</br>
Yes, I need screenshots to know for sure that a certain range is 100% passed.</br>
After all, if someone cheats and the key is in his range, everyone will lose.<hr>

Why did you free my range? I'm still looking.</br>
Each range has a start date. </br>
If 10-12 days have passed, I check with a specific hunter about the process. </br>
If silence, the range is released. </br>
If this is the hunter's only range, it is removed.</br> 
He can return to the group later and confirm 100% completion.<hr>


I am a miner, I have a pool of 300 gpu, my brother has 170, there is access to people with 1000 gpu.</br> 
Close the challenge, give us the source, I'll find the key quickly, we'll divide the coins, etc.</br>
No, I need an encrypted key. I need to share with</br>
winner, mediator, developer, to pay compensation to hunters. </br>
If you find the key there is no guarantee to the participants. </br>
We'd better take it easy on our own.</br>
Do not consider the challenge as earnings. This is a lottery. </br>
So that you don't risk too much. </br>
You can take part to use a small part of your gpu resources.</br>
For example, 100, 200 cards, leave the rest in mining.<hr>

Bro I don't have gpu what should i do?</br>
Download Fialka M-125 search on the CPU.<hr>

You have the wrong letter.</br>
Here is the correct "F"</br>
Take your correct letter and look for yourself.<hr>

How can I rent gpu cards? I do not know how to do that.</br>
Ask for help in the group, they will help you, prompt. </br>
Unfortunately there are no instructions yet.<hr>


I will search at the end when there are few ranges left. So my chances will be higher :-)</br>
This is not logical, the key can be found earlier, or in the middle of the path.</br> 
Your odds calculations will be broken.<hr>

What are the best ranges to look for? Where are the chances?</br>
In blue, (while they are still there) because they are candidates.</br>
And so everywhere the chance is the same.<hr>

Why are some passed ranges without green check marks?</br>
The hunter passed more than 90%, but for some reason did not have time (could not) take a screenshot of 100%. </br>
There were cases when they launched from bat files, after 100% the console window closed automatically.</br>
This range is assigned to him for compensation.</br>
When there are very few ranges left, it will become free again.</br>
If another hunter passes it, then he will become its owner.<hr>

I'm worried that someone is faking a sequel from the end.</br>
Do not worry, there is a very powerful protection.</br>
Fake hex is impossible<hr>
