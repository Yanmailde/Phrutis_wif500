### Frequently asked Questions
#### Question answer:

WIF500 real?</br>
To find out, you need to go through a very large range and find out.</br>
This requires large GPU resources.

Why is the program without source codes?</br>
The correct ranges and other parameters are sewn into the WifSolverCuda program.</br>
Knowing them, the user can find the key on his own and take everything for himself.

Does the program require an internet connection?</br>
No, the program is looking for the key offline.

If I find the key can I take all the coins for myself?</br>
No, you will find the encrypted key.</br>
Only the organizers of the challenge can decrypt this key and pay you a donation.

There is a video in which there is a similar key.</br>
There are errors in the video that make the key impossible to find.

I have many GPUs. How to start?</br>
Run each GPU separately with a new range Add your card id -d ?</br>
For RTX 2070, 2080, 2090, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3090, A5000, A6000</br>
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 444 -d 0```
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 445 -d 1```
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 446 -d 2```
```wif500-30xx.exe -range 2057 -d 3```
```wif500-20xx.exe -range 888 -d 4```
If you have any difficulties with the launch, you can ask in the group

Where did the diary photo come from?
The man worked at the exchange office. 
Through it, the miner withdrew coins. 
Somehow, the miner turned to the exchange office with a request to help him restore the key in the photo from the burnt diary.
In 2017, there was no GPU program. GPU cards at that time were weaker than the GTX 1060. 
It took more than 1000 years to search on the CPU. 
This is a very difficult task. The photo went from hand to hand.
Years have passed.
I was approached by a person (intermediary) who offered to find the key for 50% of the amount. 
After counting the combinations, it turned out that I needed to rent 3364 RTX 3090 cards for 4 days.
It's $50-70,000. This is a big amount of risk.
The intermediary was asked to make a challenge and if the key is found, he will receive 10%. He agreed.
A program was developed and the challenge was launched.

Who is the owner of the diary?
This is a common stupid question. Let's say Indian. What does it change? For understanding. Bitcoin is an anonymous system. The owner is the one who has the key.

Is this theft?
No.
The author of the diary took the photo himself. 
Thus, he made a public key out of a private key and gave it to third parties.


Where is the guarantee that you will give 200 btc donat to the hunter after he gives you the encrypted key?
If you have doubts you can search by yourself. Where is the guarantee that if you find it, you will give half?
If not greedy 500 coins is a lot - enough for everyone.
I need active hunters for other challenges, so there is no point in cheating.


What happens if the key is not found?
Nothing. Write on the photo SOLVED. Let's start another challenge and we'll look for it.

How to know that the key is found by someone?
Verify transactions on the blockchain.

What happens if someone who is not a hunter finds a key like a pirate (miner)?
I doubt that anyone will share with us.
The challenge will be stopped.
While the coins are in place, we are looking for.

Why did you post a photo of the diary?
Initially, a few additional letters were crossed out in the challenge.
But, on bittalk they posted all the symbols of the key from the diary. Therefore, there is no point in hiding them.


Are you looking for a compressed key, maybe it's uncompressed?
The key is 99.9% compressed.
Experienced programmers worked on the key.
Few facts.
In the photo below is an uncompressed key.
All addresses after 03/30/2012 are compressed.
When decoded, the known part of the key yields a compressed flag.
All addresses in the blockchain transaction chain are compressed.
There are many other facts indicating that the key is compressed.


Maybe you made a mistake in the handwriting and we are looking for it wrong, there is not b but 5, the third G, etc.
Worked on the key:
1 Forensic expert (according to suicide notes) for a fee.
1 Restorer of ancient manuscripts.
3 doctors (Latin medical handwriting)
1 Apothecary (pharmacist) prescriptions from the doctor sometimes look much worse :-)
10 literate people for whom American is their native language.
Our team processed the photos, making their own expertise and experiments.
On the basis of paw examinations, kandillata were added before ?5.... These are the blue ranges in the table.
The key we are retrieving looks like this:
```5bCRZhiS5sEGMpmcRZdpAhmWLRfMmutGmPHtjVob```

Bro help?
I have a weak card, help me, tell me the key. 
I don't know how to run. Look right, 
I'm running. I don't have gpu. 
hahaha I went through everything, it's empty. 
It's fake. I don't understand anything, but you still help me.

I have a telegram full of similar messages. It's hard to answer the same questions to everyone.
Write such questions in the questions to the program. Prompt each other, who figured it out, help, discuss it there. Questions not related to the challenge do not write to me.

phrutis why are you deleting hunters and being so demanding on screenshots?
I believe that the group does not need observers (not active hunters)
Why are they there to us?
If a person is added, then he has read the rules. He should tell me the range number he has chosen and is looking for. If he only plans to do it, he will be added when he is ready.
Yes, I need screenshots to know for sure that a certain range is 100% passed.
After all, if someone cheats and the key is in his range, everyone will lose.

Why did you free my range? I'm still looking.
Each range has a start date. If 10-12 days have passed, I check with a specific hunter about the process. If silence, the range is released. If this is the hunter's only range, it is removed. He can return to the group later and confirm 100% completion.
