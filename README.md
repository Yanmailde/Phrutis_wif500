### But before that, read the following:</br>

Everyone wants to search individually to take possession of all the coins, this is logical.</br>
The range of missing symbols is very very large and everyone is spinning the same thing.</br>
Some lone hunters make the mistake of rotating ranges that don't exist, further increasing the empty search time.</br>
Sometimes they make other mistakes that make finding the key impossible.</br>
After a week of searching, they begin to realize that the range is too large.</br>
It is difficult and physically impossible to go through it, they will be disappointed, angry, and stop searching.</br>
Don't waste your time, join the challenge

### Challenge is a collective search for a key
A large range of 12 characters is divided into 3364 small ranges</br>
The program is configured correctly, it takes into account many technical aspects of searching for the initial part of the key.</br>
There is a table of hunters on which ranges are indicated in the process and passed. This way you won't pass empty ranges. </br>
This speeds up the overall search process.</br>
The advantage of the challenge is that if the key is found, each hunter will receive compensation for the range he has passed.
Donate 200 btc is a worthy reward for a find key.</br>
You decide. Good luck!</br>

## How to participate in the challenge:
If you have a GPUs:</br>
**RTX 2070, 2080, 2090, 3060, 3070, 3080, 3090, A5000, A6000** and are ready to search for a key **24/7**</br>

If you do not have a 30xx card, you can [**rent**](https://vast.ai) it and participate in a collective search. </br>
For some users, [renting](https://vast.ai) is cheaper than searching on their own PC. There is also less noise in the house.</br>
When renting, you must take into account the risk that the key may not be found at all.</br> 
You may incur losses. Think of it not as earnings, but as a lottery.

In the [**TABLE**](https://github.com/phrutis/wif500/blob/main/x64/Release/table.md), select a **FREE** range between 0-3363

Run ```wif500-30xx.exe -range 1234``` (free range 0 - 3363)

RTX A6000 4 Gkey/s = 3 days (one range)</br>
RTX 3090 4 Gkey/s = 4 days (one range)</br>
RTX 3070 2.2 Gkey/s = 6 days (one range)</br>
RTX 2070 1,4 Gkey/s = 9 days (one range)</br>
There is a continuation of the search from the last checkpoint</br>

3. Ask questions not related to the challenge.</br>

When you have a range progress 100% take a screenshot (photo) and post it in the group. </br>
